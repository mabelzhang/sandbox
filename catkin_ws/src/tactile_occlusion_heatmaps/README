Data collection of simulated tactile grasps in GraspIt

Tactile contact locations are simulated by xyzs of collisions between hand
  mesh and object mesh.


Perform raytracing test on a set of random points and point clouds in depth_scene_rendering/config/scenes_noisy.txt, and output (visible, occluded) tactile heatmap pair, indicating which points are visible or occluded by the point cloud:
$ rosrun tactile_occlusion_heatmaps occlusion_test 

Visualize input triplet (depth, visible tacile heatmap, occluded tactile heatmap) of images in depth_scene_rendering/config/scenes_noisy.txt:
$ rosrun tactile_occlusion_heatmaps visualize_heatmaps.py
