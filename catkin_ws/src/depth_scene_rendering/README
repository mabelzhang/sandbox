Uses BlenSor for rendering depth images of scenes with simulated Kinect sensor



Paths to set:
blender_add_py_paths.py
  Paths of Python files to add to Blender search path
config_paths.py
  Path of data output


In Blender, choose a pane you'd like to switch to console view, press Shift+F4.

From within Blender console, run this to add the Python scripts to Blender
  search path:
  >>> exec(open('/media/master/Data_Ubuntu/courses/research/graspingRepo/visuotactile_grasping/catkin_ws/src/depth_scene_rendering/src/blender_add_py_paths.py').read())

Now Blender knows about all scripts in the src directory.

Import whatever functions you need, from the files in the added directories:
>>> from scan_kinect import scan_kinect

Now you can use the functions in Blender:
>>> scan_kinect ()
