Uses BlenSor for rendering depth images of scenes with simulated Kinect sensor



Paths to define:
blender_add_py_paths.py
  Paths of Python files to add to Blender search path
config_paths.py
  Path of data output


==============================================================================
Generate BlenSor scenes

Entry point: scene_generation.py
Core implementation of BlenSor Kinect scanning: scan_kinect.py


To run from terminal:
$ blensor -P scene_generation.py

Headless (add -b):
$ blensor -b -P scene_generation.py



To run from Blender:

In Blender, choose a pane you'd like to switch to console view, press Shift+F4.

From within Blender console, run this to add the Python scripts to Blender
  search path:
  >>> exec(open('/media/master/Data_Ubuntu/courses/research/graspingRepo/visuotactile_grasping/catkin_ws/src/depth_scene_rendering/src/blender_add_py_paths.py').read())

Now Blender knows about all scripts in the src directory.

Import whatever functions you need, from the files in the added directories:
>>> from scan_kinect import scan_kinect

Now you can use the functions in Blender:
>>> scan_kinect ()


==============================================================================
Convert pcd 3D scenes to 2D images with raw depth values

Entry point: postprocess_scenes.cpp


To build:
Requires CMakeLists.txt.

To build the first time:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
